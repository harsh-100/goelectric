As a leader in the finance industry, I pride myself on my ability to direct cross-departmental teams in business and finance. My supervisors frequently commend me for being able to weigh and consider multiple perspectives and negotiate conflicting perspectives. I’m looking for suggestions and advice on how I can further cultivate my expertise in this field because my ultimate aim is to help organizations with advancing organizational goals as a recognized thought leader and pivotal fiscal business partner with occasional travel availability to help drive ROI. Simply put, I hone my business acumen to lead teams into meeting stakeholder-set goals. I will put my energy on your bottom-line."
